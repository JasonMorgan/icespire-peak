# Icespire Peak

This adventure is an original adaptation of the Dragons of Icespire Peak module from WotC. It's set in the Wildemount campaign setting from Critical Role and WotC.

## Significant Changes

We replace the town of Phandalin with Windgrove, a small frontier community in the Dwendalian empire located west Pride's Call. Many of the main characters and plots have been left unchanged.

### Gods

* Tempus has been replaced with Gruumsh, the Ruiner
* Tymora has been replaced with Avandra

### Locations

* Phandalin has been replaced with Windgrove
  * Windgrove has less of a focus on mining although the new mining project will likely find significant gold deposits in order to raise the stakes of the conflict with Cryovain
  * Windgrove is a hub for prospectors and hunters/woodsfolk who gather exotic resources from the Velvin Thicket or the surrounding plains/mountains
* The Dwarven Excavation site now a former temple to Tiamat
